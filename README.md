## âœ… Part 1: Edge AI Prototype

- Built a TensorFlow/Keras image classification model to detect recyclable items.
- Achieved **93.75% accuracy** after training on 4 classes (glass, metal, paper, plastic).
- Converted the model to **TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`)** for deployment on Edge devices.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Jupyter`, `TFLite`

## âœ… Part 2: AI-Driven IoT â€“ Smart Agriculture

- Designed a smart farming system using AI + IoT.
- Proposed sensors like: **Soil Moisture**, **Temperature**, **Humidity**, **Light**, and **pH**.
- Used supervised ML model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict crop yield.
- Included a **data flow diagram** showing sensor â†’ AI â†’ farmer dashboard.

## âœ… Part 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine

- Identified biases in genomic data (e.g., underrepresentation of ethnic groups in TCGA).
- Suggested fairness strategies: **diverse datasets**, **bias checks**, and **transparency**.
- Wrote a 300-word ethical reflection as part of the submission.

## âœ… Part 4: Human-AI Collaboration

- Reflected on how AI and humans can work together in fields like healthcare and design.
- Emphasized that AI should **augment**, not replace, human judgment.
- Included real-world examples like AI-assisted radiology and creative tools.
